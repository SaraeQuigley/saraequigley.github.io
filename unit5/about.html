		<h1>Thanks for joining me!</h1>
		<br></br>
		<p>Although this site showcases photos, I am in no way trying to pass myself off as a professional photographer. More of a novice-traveler-and-photographer. I love to travel and have had the opportunity to explore quite a few parts of the world over the years. I first got the travel bug when I studied abroad in Florence, Italy in college. I'd send my parents lengthy emails trying in vain to put the scenes before me into words. To my great disappointment, I could not capture the beauty of my surroundings in words.</p>
		<br></br> 
		<p>Ill-equipped with a lifeless digital camera, no smart phone and a case of writer's block, I was frustrated at the thought that soon I'd go home and would leave these experiences behind, unable to share them with others back home. Stories would have to do for the time-being, but I knew this would not be a sustainable method. There was no way the even the most expansive imaginations could invent scenes like those I'd witnessed. I was too enamoured with every site and sound I came across and knew if I continued to travel I couldn't keep it all to myself.</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>Some years later, after graduating college, I was working in New York City at a job that did allow me to travel, but also forced me to work for commission. I loved the project but not the commission aspect. I promised myself that if I stuck it out I'd reward myself by using my first commission to buy myself a decent DSLR camera. I had never used one at that point but felt the need to look at the world through one.</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>I've had the chance to travel to many beautiful places with friends - like Iceland, Belize, and deserts of the US - and many others with just my passport and camera - like Stockholm, Vancouver, and back to Italy. Each time, my trusty camera was strapped to my shoulder, soaking in the sights with me. Not having an expert shot, I tend to take roughly a few hundred photos of the same scene, unsure whether or not any will come out well that I can share with friends back home, but figure the odds are on my side - the more I take the more chances that at least one comes out. Many are blurry, many are out of focused, but once and a while one is just right. Each captures the location as I saw it though, shaky-handed and enamored.</p>

		<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
