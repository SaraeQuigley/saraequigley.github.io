		<h1>Thanks for joining me!</h1>

		<p>Although this site showcases photos, I am not in any way trying to pass myself off as a professional photographer. More of a novice-traveler-and-photographer. I love to travel and have had the opportunity to explore quite a few parts of the world over the years. I first got the travel bug when I studied abroad in Florence, Italy in college. I'd send my parents lengthy emails trying in vain to put the scene into words. To my great disappointment, I could not capture the beauty of my surroundings in words - despite the techniques gained in ewriting classes I was taking there.</p> 
		<p>Ill-equipped with a lifeless digital camera, no smart phone and writer's block, I was frustrated at the thought that soon I'd go home and wouldn't be able to share these experiences with others. How could my family not experience this beauty? Stories would have to do for the time-being, but I knew this would not be a sustainable method. I was too enamoured with every site and sound I came across and knew if I continued to travel I couldn't keep it all to myself.</p>
		<p>Some years later, after graduating college, I was working in New York City at a job that did allow me to actually put my degree to use, and also to travel. I ended up working on a commission-based project which I didn't love - loved the project, didn't love the commission aspect - so I promised myself that if I was able to earn enough in a certain span of time, I'd use the commission to buy myself a decent DSLR camera. I had never used one at that point but felt it was necessary although I'd never used one at that point. How hard could it be?</p>
		<p>I've had the chance to travel to many beautiful places with friends - like Iceland, Belize, and deserts of the US - and many others by myself - like Stockholm, Vancouver, and back to Italy. Each time, my trusty camera was strapped to my shoulder. Not having an expert shot, I tend to take roughly a few hundred photos of the same scene, unsure whether or not any will come out well, figuring odds are on my side the more I take. Many are blurry, many are out of focused, but once and a while one is just right.</p>
		<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
