		<h1>Hello, nice to meet you.</h1>
		<p>Do I claim to be a photographer? Oh heck no! I claim to be a regular gal who enjoys seeing the world, and hopes to see every last inch of her at some point.</p>
		<p>I've been blessed with the good fortune that has allowed me the opportunity to travel a decent amount over recent years. I spent a decent amount of that decent amount of time have I lost you yet? traveling solo. I imagine the solo traveler version of myself as a cartoon character who's eyes become 4x their original size immediately upon exiting whatever plane, train or automobile has transported me to the latest location. Each location after the last contains a unique beauty and personality that causes cartoon-version self's jaw to drop to the ground. How could there be so much beauty?<p>
		<p>During these times I find myself enraptured, then find myself looking for someone else to appreciate the scene with - or at least pinch me to prove its all real.</p>
		<p>Due to this longing, I usually end up taking approximately 37.5 photos of the same exact scene so that there's no possibility I go home without some proof that it really exists.</p>
		<p>And guess what? Once in a while one of those photos comes out well! Like really well! This is site is my way of share what I've seen, found beauty in, and captured with my shakey hands and my lense. I hope you'll enjoy!</p>
